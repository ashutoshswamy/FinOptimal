## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Calm blue (#5DADE2) to establish trust and reliability, reminiscent of traditional financial institutions. The hue evokes serenity, safety, and stability, ideal for managing finances.
- Background color: Light blue-gray (#F0F4F8) that is soft and unobtrusive, creating a comfortable viewing experience that will prevent eye strain. It maintains the blue tone, which enforces a sense of dependability without overwhelming the user.
- Accent color: Muted purple (#A98DDF) for highlighting key interactive elements, providing a modern and sophisticated flair. Purple also is the next color on the color wheel, but provides a vibrant contrast against blue tones.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif combining a modern look with warmth, is for body text, and 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif), with its techy feel, will be used for headlines.
- Clean, minimal layout with a focus on essential information; implement progressive disclosure, showing basic options first and advanced settings on demand, consistent layouts across all calculators, and proper contrast ratios.
- Use Lucide React icons for a consistent and modern look across the application.
- Implement subtle animations for generating new calculations and chart updates, providing a smooth user experience.
